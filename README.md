- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gerardo Macias and I'm a Mathematician undergraduate ðŸ‘€
-  Iâ€™m currently working in topics that involves Deep Learning like FeedForward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, etc. Some projects that I have developed are related with Classification Images and I expected so soon wind up a generating text project with a small transformer using transfer learning. Other topics that I'm related are Social Networks.
